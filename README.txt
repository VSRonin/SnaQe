SNAQE by V Ronin

This is a version of the classical snake game built using Qt libraries.

CoordinateCorpo.h defines a class to hold the coordinates of the items in the game.
snake.h and snake.cpp define the widget implementing the game.
Opzioni.h and Opzioni.cpp define the widget used to adjust the game settings
SelettoreImmagini.h and SelettoreImmagini.cpp define a widget used in the WOpzioni class to select the scheme
StyleSheet.h contains the stylesheet of the widgets
snake.qrc is the resource file "containing" the images used

Since the program is pure C++ and Qt you can build and run the program on all the major platforms.
You can download the qt libraries, needed to build the program, from http://qt.nokia.com
